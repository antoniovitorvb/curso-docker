# Curso de Docker

Forneciddo por: [Cod3r Cursos Online](www.cod3r.com.br)

In this course I've learned how to build isolated development environments, a.k.a. `containers` and how to integrate them to execute tasks/microservices together.

Common situations while developing a product such "it works in my computer" could be avoided or mitigated in a standardized environment. `Containers` are able to provide these isolated envs.
